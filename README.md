                   Title:Crowd Counting And Density Estimation
Objective:
The objective of crowd counting is to estimate the number of people in an image or video, while density estimation focuses on mapping how people are spatially distributed. These help in public safety, event management, urban planning, and smart surveillance.

Technology:
Crowd counting and density estimation use computer vision, deep learning (CNNs), density maps, object detection models (e.g., YOLO), and tracking algorithms to estimate the number and distribution of people in images or videos.

Usage:
Used for crowd control, public safety, urban planning, retail analysis, transport management, health monitoring, and smart surveillance.

conclusion:
Crowd counting and density estimation are essential technologies for monitoring and managing people in various environments. They improve safety, efficiency, and planning in areas like public events, transportation, retail, and smart cities by providing accurate data on crowd size and distribution.
